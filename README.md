Custom label designed for counts and tallying. Set a descriptor (example: 20 "Points") and it auto sets the plural vs singular of the descriptor, for dynamic values not available at runtime. The control also provides a customizable tally animation to count from n1 to n2, with a callback once the tally has completed. You can also display and tally the label with an "out of N" suffix (example: "20/100 Points")
